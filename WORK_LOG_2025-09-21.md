# Development Log - January 18, 2025

## Project: Habit Tracker App - Social Features & Username System

### Session Overview
- **Duration**: Full day development session
- **Focus**: Bug fixes, friend system improvements, and username system implementation
- **Key Outcomes**: Fixed critical search display bug, enhanced friend request system, laid foundation for username system

---

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Search Results Display Issue (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Add Friend modal search results were not visible to users despite data being returned correctly.

**Root Cause**: CSS styling issue where `flex: 1` was causing the search results container to have no visible height, making results invisible even though they were being rendered.

**Solution Applied**:
```css
// Before (problematic):
searchResultsContainer: {
  flex: 1,
  maxHeight: 280,
  // ... other styles
}

// After (fixed):
searchResultsContainer: {
  minHeight: 200,
  maxHeight: 350,
  // ... other styles
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/screens/Social/FriendsListScreen.tsx` - Updated container styling
- Removed debug styling (yellow background, red borders)
- Cleaned up console.log statements

**Impact**: Users can now see and interact with search results properly, with space for 3+ results and proper scrolling.

## ü§ù Friend System Enhancements

### 2. Sent Friend Requests Tracking
**Feature Added**: Users can now see pending friend requests they've sent out.

**Implementation**:
- Added "Sent Requests" section in Social tab
- Displays pending outgoing requests with recipient names
- Shows "Cancel Request" button for each pending request
- Auto-refreshes after actions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/screens/Social/FriendsListScreen.tsx` - Added sent requests UI
- `src/services/supabase.ts` - Added `getSentFriendRequests()` function
- Database queries updated to handle bidirectional request tracking

### 3. Duplicate Friend Request Prevention
**Problem**: Users could send multiple friend requests to the same person, causing database constraint violations.

**Solution**:
- Updated `sendFriendRequest` function to check for existing requests
- If request exists and is 'declined', update to 'pending' instead of inserting new record
- Added "Already Friends" button state for existing friends
- Improved error handling for edge cases

**Database Changes**:
- Enhanced `friend_requests` table handling
- Updated RLS policies for better request management

### 4. Friend Charts Loading Fix
**Problem**: Friends' progress charts weren't appearing on Home page despite having commitments.

**Root Cause**: RLS policies were too restrictive, preventing friends from viewing each other's commitments.

**Solution**:
- Updated RLS policies for `commitments` and `commitment_records` tables
- Added `is_private` column to `commitments` table (default: false)
- Modified policies to respect privacy settings
- Updated `getFriendsChartsData` to return all friends (even without commitments)

**Files Modified**:
- Database migration: `supabase/migrations/006_add_usernames.sql`
- `src/services/supabase.ts` - Updated friend data fetching functions
- `src/screens/Dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx` - Enhanced friends charts display

### 5. UI Refresh Improvements
**Enhancement**: Friend actions now properly update the interface without requiring logout/login.

**Implementation**:
- Created `useFriendsCharts` hook with `triggerFriendsChartsRefresh` function
- Added refresh calls after friend accept/remove actions
- Improved state management for real-time UI updates
- Enhanced `loadFriendsData()` integration

## üè∑Ô∏è Username System Foundation

### 6. Database Schema for Usernames
**New Feature**: Laid foundation for username system to replace email-based identification.

**Database Changes**:
```sql
-- New usernames table
CREATE TABLE usernames (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  username VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Updated existing users with test usernames
UPDATE profiles SET username = 'test1' WHERE email = 'justin@shapeswithsoul.com';
UPDATE profiles SET username = 'test2' WHERE email = 'taesongkim@gmail.com';
-- ... etc
```

**Files Created**:
- `supabase/migrations/006_add_usernames.sql` - Username table and data migration
- `supabase/migrations/007_update_friends_functions_for_usernames.sql` - Updated RPC functions
- `src/utils/usernameValidation.ts` - Username validation utilities

### 7. Username Validation System
**Implementation**: Created comprehensive username validation with business rules.

**Validation Rules**:
- Length: 3-20 characters
- Characters: Alphanumeric + underscore only
- Must start with letter or number
- No consecutive underscores
- No leading/trailing underscores

**Code Structure**:
```typescript
// src/utils/usernameValidation.ts
export const validateUsername = (username: string): ValidationResult => {
  // Comprehensive validation logic
  // Returns success/failure with specific error messages
}
```

### 8. Friend Search by Username
**Enhancement**: Updated friend search to use usernames instead of emails for better UX.

**Changes**:
- Modified `search_users_by_email` RPC function to search by username
- Updated frontend to display usernames in search results
- Enhanced friend display throughout the app
- Maintained backward compatibility with email-based searches

**Database Functions Updated**:
- `get_user_friends()` - Now returns usernames
- `search_users_by_email()` - Now searches by username (function name kept for compatibility)
- Added proper type casting for VARCHAR(20) to TEXT compatibility

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **CSS Flexbox Issues**: `flex: 1` can cause unexpected height collapse in containers
2. **Database Type Compatibility**: VARCHAR vs TEXT type mismatches can cause RPC function failures
3. **State Management**: Proper refresh triggers are crucial for real-time UI updates
4. **User Experience**: Small UI issues (like invisible search results) can completely block functionality
5. **Incremental Development**: Fixing one issue often reveals others that need attention
